           <center><h3> Who Offers Care?  </h3> </center> 
            <p>
               The American healthcare system <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/health/democratic-debate-healthcare.html"> took center stage </a> during the recent Democratic primary debates. Questions like "Should a single government plan replace privatized healthcare?" and "Must affordable care must be governmnet run?" <a href = "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-healthcare-factbox/where-the-top-democratic-us-presidential-candidates-stand-on-medicare-for-all-idUSKCN1VV13A">  divide  candidates</a>. The proposals are complicated including public systems, private systems, and a mix of both. But why do those factors matter? How do the organizations providing care affect how people access it? To  contextualize this debate, we analyzed healthcare plans offered through the current government-facilitated system created through the Affordable Care Act.         
            </p>
        
            <p> First, some background. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows people to purchase health insurace directly from private insurance companies without needing sponsorship from an employer. You work hourly or part time and do not receive health benefits? No problem. You can go to <a href = "https://www.healthcare.gov"> healthcare.gov </a>  and purchase a plan with guaranteed minimum coverage standards. Your plan will be operated by a private company that works in your area. This is different from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Those programs are administered by the government, not private companies, and offer care to very specific demographics.          
            </p>
            
             <p> <center> <strong> The ACA allowed any citizen to purchase private health insurance </strong>    </center>
            </p>
                  
            <p> Under this system, individual states must attract private insurance companies to offer plans to their residents. Within states, plan offerings are further restricted to Rating Areas – collections of counties that all share  physicians, clinics, pharmacies, and other health providers. So if you are covered by an insurance company, lets name it HealthWorks, and live in in Southern California, you may have access to a different set of plans than a person living in Northern California who also is covered by HealthWorks. The company cooperates with different physicians in different parts of the state. In fact, the plans available can vary significantly from county to county. Using public data curated by the <a href = "https://hixcompare.org/" > Robert Wood Johnson Foundation </a> we analyze the variations in plans available to individual consumers and the implications of those differences.

                <center> <h3> Glossary </h3></center>
                <strong>Issuer:</strong> A company that offers health insurance <br>
                <strong>Rating Area:</strong> A collection of counties or zip codes that all have the same plans and care networks<br>
                <strong>Plan:</strong> A unique set of healthcare benefits offered at a specific premium and deductible in a specific rating area. We have eliminated Cost-Sharing Reduction plans which are copies of other plans offered at lower cost to individuals in certain income brackets. <br>
                <strong>Premium:</strong> The price per month to own insurance. In these analyses, we utilize premiums offered to single 27 year olds. <br>
                <strong> Deductible:</strong> An threshold of money that, once paid by the patient, affects how the insurer will cover the rest of the care. Oftentimes, the patient pays either a substantially reduced or no fee above the deductible.

     <p>
    Privatized healthcare systems rely on capitalism and competition. With a single company controlling all available plans, residents cannot put economic pressure on the issuer to adjust its offerings. Keep scrolling to see how this plays out. But first, another definition:

    <p>
  <strong>Silver Plan:</strong> A health insurance plan with a medium amount of coverage. All silver plans offer equivalent benefits and address key healthcare needs. They are the most common plan choice. The government also provides Silver Plans at reduced cost to individuals who qualify for financial assistance.

         So, now we know. Individuals who live in counties with fewer issuers often cannot access as affordable coverage as individuals who live across county lines. But if we know coverage costs more, are there any differences in benefits?

        Lack of competition affects the cost of your coverage,  what your coverage actually pays for, and your ability to choose what you would like it to cover. Whatever healthcare scheme is offered to America next, it must make an effort to reduce disparities in coverage options that result simply from where people live. This election cycle, lets use data to keep our officials accountable, tranforming the idea of healthcare for all into <strong>equal</strong> care for all.

                 <center> <h1 style="color: black;">How Did We Put This Together?</h1> </center>             

                 <h3>The Data:</h3>
                <p >
                    The data for this analyses was compiled by the <a href = "https://www.rwjf.org/" > Robert Wood Johnson Foundation </a> as part of their <a href = "https://hixcompare.org/"> HIX Compare Initiative </a>. We specifically utilized the 2019 data included in the <a href = "https://hixcompare.org/individual-markets.html"> Individual Market </a> files.       
                </p> 
                
                 <p>
                <strong> Number of Plans and Issuers: </strong> The HIX Compare set compiles a list of issuers and plans that operate in each county in the United States. In it, a unique plan is defined as a  set of benefits offered at a given premium and available in a specific Rating Area. Cost Sharing Reduction variants (plans that are offered to certain groups based on income level) and Child-Only plans (plans marketed to specifically cover children), do not qualify as unique plans within the HIX compare set. Additionally, only plans that are actively marketed through the state website were considered in this analysis. Issuers and number of plans were linked to counties using the State FIPS code, a unique 5-digit code that relates to a specific US county. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                 <strong>Counties: </strong> Rating areas vary significantly between states. For example, Florida has 67, almost one per county, while New Hampshire only has one. So we settled on counties as the most basic unit of our analysis since they are one of the more uniform geographic units between states. That said, since rating areas can be a bit weird and do not always line up with counties, we, on occassion, had to count a county twice. Alaska, for example, has a few counties where half of the county can access one set of plans and the other half can only a distinctly different set. Why is it not uniform? States have the right to decide how they want to regulate healthcare. So, sometimes that is just the way things settle out.               
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <strong>Silver Plans:</strong> When analyzing the cost of silver plans, we used the same definition as HIX Compare. We removed CSR and Child-Only variants. We limited some analyses only to silver plans in order to improve comparability between plans, counties, and states. Plans at different metal levels are very different from eachother. And, given that individuals who qualify for financial relief only receive it if they purchase a Silver Plan, it is the most reasonable plan type to analyze. 
                </p>
                
                
                

                <p> <strong>Premiums: </strong> Premiums are calibrated to the individual who purchases the plan. Do you have a family? Are you elderly? These are questions that can change your premium cost. The HIX compare includes a few values, but we chose to  base this story around a single 27-year old to streamline some of the calculations. That said, all of the benefit structures are the same no matter your demographics. 
                           </p>
                
                <p>
                <strong> In Network/Out-of-Network & Coverage Tiers: </strong> For this analysis, we tried to be as generous to insurance companies as possible to avoid pointing fingers where there is no blame. All insurance companies have different benefits based on whether your doctor is considered in or out of network. All calculations were based on the assumption that the patient received in network care. Unfortunately, in emergency situations, this does not always occur. Additionally, some plans further differentiate in network providers into tier 1 (preferred) and tier 2 (non-preffered) providers. Again, we assumed the best and looked at how a company would treat a patient who reached a preferred provider. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Statistics Jargon of the Day:</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>Median:</strong> If you line up a set of numbers in ascending order, the median is the number physically in the middle. Why do we use medians to describe premiums in this piece? Well, we want to tell you that 50% of people are paying more than that amount and 50% of people are paying less than that amount. Sometimes people like to use <i>means</i> (fancy name for <i>average</i>) to describe the middle of a data set. But, unfortunately, very large numbers and very small numbers can bias the mean. In this case, some people pay an exhorbitant amount for their care. 
                    
                </p>
                
                
                <h3>Future Work:</h3>

                <p>
                    We are working to analyze more benefits to add to the county report card. If there is a benefit type that is important to you, let us know and we will take a look at where that care is offered.
