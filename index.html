           <center><h3> Who Offers Care?  </h3> </center> 
            <p>
               The state of the American healthcare system <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/health/democratic-debate-healthcare.html"> took center stage </a> during the Democratic primary debates of the last few months. Questions of whether privatized healthcare should be abolished in favor of a single government plan and or if affordable healthcare must be governmnet-administered <a href = "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-healthcare-factbox/where-the-top-democratic-us-presidential-candidates-stand-on-medicare-for-all-idUSKCN1VV13A"> differentiate the candidates</a>. Public, private, a mix of both, the dynamics and proposals are complicated. But how does who offers healthcare affect how people can access it? To  contextualize this debate, we analyzed offerings of the current government-facilitated healthcare system created through the Affordable Care Act under the Obama Administration that took effect in 2014.         
            </p>
        
            <p> First, some background. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) created a way for individuals and small groups of individuals to purchase health insurace from American private insurance companies without needing sponsorship from an employer. You work part time and do not have health benefits from your employer? No problem. You can go to <a href = "https://www.healthcare.gov"> healthcare.gov </a>  and purchase a plan with guarenteed minimum coverage standards from a company that operates in your area. This is different from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. They subsidized health insurance they provide for qualified individuals is administered by the government and not private companies.          
            </p>
            
             <p> <center> <strong> The ACA allowed any citizen to purchase private health insurance with minimum coverage</strong>    </center>
            </p>
                  
            <p> Under this system, individual states must attract private insurance companies to offer plans to residents within their states. National, regional, and local issures can offer plans on a state market as long as there are physicians in the area who will accept the insurance. Within states, plan offerings are further restricted to Rating Areas – collections of counties that comprise a healthcare network. So hypothetically, a person living in Southern California may have access to one set of plans operated by the ficticious company HealthWorks while and individual in Northern California could access different plans operated by HealthWorks since the company cooperates with different physicians in different parts of the state. In fact, the plans available can vary significantly between county to county. Using public data curated by the <a href = "https://hixcompare.org/" > Robert Wood Johnson Foundation </a> we analyze the variations in plans available to individual consumers and the implications of those differences.

                <center> <h3> Glossary </h3></center>
                <strong>Issuer:</strong> A company that offers health insurance <br>
                <strong>Rating Area:</strong> A collection of counties or zip codes that all have the same plans and care networks<br>
                <strong>Plan:</strong> A unique set of healthcare benefits offered at a specific premium and deductible in a specific rating area. We have eliminated Cost-Sharing Reduction plans which are copies of other plans offered at lower cost to individuals in certain income brackets. <br>
                <strong>Premium:</strong> The price per month to own insurance. In these analyses, we utilize premiums offered to single 27 year olds. <br>
                <strong> Deductible:</strong> An threshold of money that, once paid by the patient, affects how the insurer will cover the rest of the care. Oftentimes, the patient pays either a substantially reduced or no fee above the deductible.

     <p>
    Privatized healthcare systems rely on capitalism and competition. With a single company controlling all available plans, residents cannot put economic pressure on the issuer to adjust its offerings. Keep scrolling to see how this plays out. But first, another definition:
    </p>  
       
    <p>
  <strong>Silver Plan:</strong> A health insurance plan with a medium amount of coverage. They all offer relatively equivalent benefits and address most healthcare needs. They are the most common choice for Market place shoppers and are the plan level that the government provides to qualified individuals at reduced cost-sharing.

            <p>
         So, now we know. Individuals who live in counties with fewer issuers, specifically in Single Issuer Districts, often do not have access to as affordable coverage as individuals who live across county lines. But if it costs more to access coverage, are there any differences in accessible benefits?

         The lack of competition affects not just the cost of acquiring coverage, it affects what your coverage will actually pay for and your ability to choose what you would like it to cover. Whatever healthcare plan is offered to America next, if it is to center on creating equity in healthcare access, it must make an effort to reduce disparities in coverage options that result simply from residence. This election cycle, lets use data to keep our officials accountable, tranforming healthcare for all into <strong>equal</strong> care for all.
